#MyNews

Imagine you got a request from popular news website(like BBC or any other) to develop mobile app for their users. You can use any online news feed, for instance https://newsapi.org. Customer wants the application to work offline, as users need to be able to read articles with no internet connection.

Main screen:
- shows a list of news
- each cell contains small image, title, date
- has loading indication
- has Pull to Refresh feature

News Details screen:
- opens when you tap cell on Main screen
- has bigger image, title, date, news short description, clickable link to full article

Notes:
- first step - create public GitHub repo for your project, push commits as you go, we assume you have more then 1 commit
- use any popular 3-rd party libraries/frameworks
- application should work fine for any screen size and orientation
- application should support latest iOS/Android OS versions to cover 90% of users
- last step, make a short video presentation of implemented app in English to your customer, show how the app works, what tech stack you use.
